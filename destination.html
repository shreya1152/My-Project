<h1>Destinations of Mumbai</h1>
<h4>Siddhivinayak Temple</h4>
<p>Shree Siddhivinayak temple which is located at Prabhadevi is very famous and favourite as Desire Fulfilling Shrine of Greater Mumbai. This ancient shrine is a place of worship for finding solace for its devotees and the pilgrims all over the globe. It was on the Kartik Shuddha Chaturdashi of the Shalivahan Samvatsar 1723 as per the Hindu calendar year (A.D. 1801) that itâ€™s first renovation was done, performing all rituals as per the Hindu religious commandment. It appears from available sources of information and it is evident that the shrine exists here since last 200 years. Identical idol comprised of marble is also existing in the Banganga complex located in South Mumbai. It seems that both these idols are carved by a single artisan. Considering that the old Banganga shrine complex is more than 500 years old,It can be said that the structure of the shrine in the Prabhadevi temple  must have been about 500 years old.</p>
